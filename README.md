I spent a decade perfecting the art of making hamburgers, only to realize that there was more to life than burgers. Inspired to pursue something more, I turned to the field of electricity and enrolled in an electrician program. Simultaneously, I inadvertently registered in a "lukio" (Finnish upper secondary school) and ended up juggling both studies. Over time, I found the theoretical aspects more fascinating than the practical work of fixing electrical issues. This led me to Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, where I dove into the study of software engineering and was fortunate to secure employment in my first year.

For the following ten years, I honed my skills in coding. PHP was my mainstay, supplemented by occasional forays into Java and Groovy, frequent ventures into JavaScript and SQL, a touch of CSS, and then TypeScript. My tools of choice varied, ranging from Symfony 2 to Angular 2, and sometimes a combination of both.

Over the years, I've embarked on all sorts of web projects, varying in length from six months to several years. My work spanned from consultation to product development, and occasionally project management. I have become battle-hardened through countless customer interfaces to the point where I find it enjoyable.
