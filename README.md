I used to make hamburgers for 10 years then i realized there is more than burgers in life. So i went to study as an electrician.
I accidentally enrolled to "lukio" at the same time and did end up making both of the studies. Realized the theoretical stuff was more interesting than fixing electric stuff
and therefor went for Metropolia AMK to study software engineering. Got hired the first year of studies.

Coded php for another 10 years and occasional java and groovy, many times javascript and some sql, bit of css and then typescript.
Sometimes with symfony 2, sometimes with Angular 2, sometimes with both.

Been doing all kind of web projects from 6 months to several years in length.
Consultation and product development, sometimes project management.
Hard-boiled in customer interfaces to a point where it actually is nice.
